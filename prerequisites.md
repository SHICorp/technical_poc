Hey {{CANDIDATE_NAME}}!

I hope this message finds you well. We are looking forward to our upcoming technical interview and wanted to provide you with some insights into the format and nature of the exercises you'll be undertaking.

The main part of the interview will be a practical, hands-on exercise designed to allow you to demonstrate your skills and knowledge with Azure, Terraform, and IaC. We will provide you with a barebones starter solution and a set of requirements and ask you to make additional modifications.

The exercise is designed to take approximately 45 minutes. You'll need to walk through your solution, explaining the decisions you made and how your implementation works. With that in mind, here are some things you should have ready before the technical interview:

**Functioning webcam** - You must be on camera for the technical interview. We will allow you to turn your camera off while you share your screen to work through the exercise.

Please come prepared with a development environment with the following tools preinstalled:

- **Git** - As part of the exercise, you will be asked to use 'git' commands to interact with the code repositories in Github.
- **Code Editor** - preferably one you are familiar with and have previously worked with. VSCode is our general favorite. But if you prefer another editor, that is fine. We want you to use tools that you are most comfortable with.
- **Terraform** - The bulk of this exercise is Terraform. You must have the Terraform CLI installed on your machine.
- **Azure CLI** - This will be an experiment for us. We created a Lab Azure Subscription that is isolated. During the interview, we will invite you to the lab subscription, which will allow you to deploy your resources from your local machine. Please be prepared to run Azure CLI commands from a terminal window.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about the upcoming interview. We're looking forward to seeing how you approach and solve this problem.

Thanks,
